# Voron 2.4 Oven Mod

The Voron 2.4 Oven Mod is a creative solution designed to improve the performance and longevity of your Voron 2.4 3D printer. This mod was developed in response to difficulties encountered while printing and assembling the nevermore mod. It aims to manage the chamber temperature effectively and is compatible with LDO axial fans for the nevermore upgrade.

## Why this mod?

The primary objective of this mod is to enhance the overall 3D printing experience by addressing several common issues:

- Maintenance-Free: This mod requires minimal maintenance, saving you valuable time and effort.
- No Carbon Filter Replacement: Eliminates the need for carbon filter replacements, further reducing maintenance requirements.
- Fan Longevity: By situating the fans away from the heatbed, they are not subjected to hot air, potentially extending their lifespan.
- Even Air Distribution: The mod promotes uniform air distribution from the heatbed, minimizing hot-air turbulences and promoting even heating of the heatbed.
- Accessible Purge Bucket: It includes a conveniently accessible, magnetic purge bucket.

## Requirements

To install this mod, you will need:

- Materials as per the Voron case recommendations (ASA/ABS or higher temperature resistant material)
- Prolonged Z endstop rod (33mm)
- 2 axial 52mm fans (LDO or Delta)
- Voron 2.4 300mm version (other versions can mount the back and front fan shroud, the draft shields are not yet compatible)
- Exhaust fan mod to prevent overheating
- M3 screws, T-nuts, and heat-set inserts

## Installation Instructions

1. **Print all parts**: Minimum required parts include the inverted Z-endstop and oven_back cover.
   
2. **Preparations**:
   
   2.1. Mount and test the reversed Z-endstop and the 33mm long, 5mm diameter rod. (Hint: You can use a hook purchased from a home craft store, cut it to the right length with a metal saw, then file off all sharp edges)
   
   2.2. Install the fans into the oven_back_cover and prepare the cabling for the controller board.
   
3. **Mounting**:
   
   3.1. If available, install the draft shields first. With a bit of careful manipulation, they can be installed with the buildplate in place.
   
   3.2. Install the back and front cover, and connect the fans.

Remember to always take necessary precautions while handling and installing the components. Happy printing!
